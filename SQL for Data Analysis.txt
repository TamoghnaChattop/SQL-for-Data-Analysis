This repository contains the quizzes along with their SQL commands for the concepts taught in the course SQL for Data Analysis by MODE at Udacity.

You can restore the toy dataset "parch and posey" to your local machines from the file parch_and_posey_db using the following steps:

1. Create a new database - CREATE DATABASE parch_and_posey;
2. Restore into the database - pg_restore -d parch_and_posey /path/to/parch_and_posey_db

Now, SQL commands can be used to explore the dataset and run queries on it.
